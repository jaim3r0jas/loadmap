### Minor Changes

- a71e332: Every tier lane is filled: the first, third… in the new theme token `--lm-tier-base`, the others in `--lm-tier`, with
  the lane shades and headers a step apart in both themes. `lanes: striped` (`lanes: 'striped'` in the view) brings back
  every other lane clear. A tier can have a colour of its own, `tier data "Data" { fill: "#e6f2ec"; fillDark: "#1c2b26" }`
  (`fill` and `fillDark` beside its `label` in TypeScript); without `fillDark`, dark keeps the colour's hue as dark as the
  theme's lanes, and `fillDark` alone leaves light the theme's. In a definition a colour is hex, `rgb()` or `hsl()`:
  `compile` refuses anything else, such as a `url(…)` that would fetch from a shared link, and now also what only looks
  like one (`"#12345"`, `"rgb(1)"`), for flows' colours too. Exports write a lane's own colours in rgb, as they write the
  theme's tokens.

  In the editor, **View** switches the lanes' fills and the canvas's dot grid (`grid: false`, read only by the editor),
  which now shows through the lanes; the model's tab gives each lane a light and a dark colour, and Reset takes them out.
  Each is one edit of the text: `setProperty` writes, changes or takes out a property of the definition or of a tier.

### Minor Changes

- 1d0cc1f: Tiers are drawn as lanes. Each tier has a header at its start, a strip across the top (running down, and on a phone, a
  column on the left, the name reading up), with its name in capitals; a line between the lanes, and every other lane
  shaded. A name wider than its lane takes two lines, and every header on that board takes two; only past two lines is it
  cut short with "…". The layout reserves the header's room, so no box or edge label sits under one: `collisions()`
  checks the whole header. Export, posters and the editor draw the same lanes.

  `SceneTier` has `head` (the header's box), `lines` (each line of the name with its spot; a line that comes or goes in
  a morph fades) and `spacing`, in place of `text` and `spot`. Four theme tokens colour the lanes: `--lm-tier` (a shaded
  lane), `--lm-tier-head`, `--lm-tier-fg` (the name) and `--lm-tier-line` (the dividers).

### Patch Changes

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- d8fa10d: Each scenario, story step, preset and choice of a select or switch is laid out on its own by default (`layout:
  'compact'` on the view, `layout: compact` in a `.loadmap`), over every load and every value of the range controls, and
  the boxes move from one to the next: a long story no longer pays for its largest step in every step. Dragging the load
  or a range control still never moves a box, and a step looks the same whichever came before. `layout: stable` keeps
  the old promise that no phase moves a box. In a stable layout, an edge whose `when` turns on partway up the load range
  no longer moves the boxes when the load reaches it.

  In the language the direction is now `direction: right | down`; `layout: right` and `layout: down` still work, with a
  warning, and `loadmap fmt` rewrites them. A `<Loadmap>` page loads 0.4 kB more; its budget is 51.5 kB.

### Minor Changes

- 7886094: A diagram without `layout` (or `direction`) runs right, or down when it fans out wider than it is long: when its
  widest layer has more boxes than its longest chain. The layers are counted as ELK draws them: every edge counts,
  whatever its `when` (so the load and the phases never turn it), a loop is cut where the flow comes back, a sink or
  store that feeds nothing stands in the last layer, and a box with no edge is left out. `directionOf(view)` gives it
  (from `@loadmap/layout` and `@loadmap/react`), and `layout()` runs by it when no direction is given; narrow screens
  still run down.

### Patch Changes

- @loadmap/core@0.14.0

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 2d8c547: The boxes nothing feeds stand first along the flow, and a sink or store that feeds nothing stands last. Tiers cut the
  diagram into bands across the flow (edge, services, data): `tier edge "Edge"` declares one, in the order the flow
  meets them, and `tier: edge` puts a box in it (`tiers: { edge: { label: 'Edge' } }` in the view and `tier: 'edge'`
  on a box in TypeScript). A box without a tier stands in the tier of the boxes that feed it. Each tier is a band behind
  its boxes, every other one shaded, with its label in the margin before them: across the top running right, up the
  left side running down and on a phone. `Scene.tiers` holds the bands; `collisions()` checks their labels too.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 497f671: No scenario, story step, preset or control moves a box any more. ELK lays out every box at the largest size it takes
  anywhere the model reaches, and each box is drawn at its own size in the middle of that slot: a pool that gains pods
  grows where it stands and its neighbours stay put. What it reaches: the defaults, each scenario, story step and
  declared preset, and every combination of the controls (a range at each step, or at points across a long one); past
  256 combinations, each control's options one at a time from each scenario, step and preset. Edges leave and enter a
  box at the middle of its sides, and an edge that comes or goes (`when`) keeps its room. Values nothing declared
  reaches (a combination past that bound that draws a box larger) lay out again, as before.

  `model.stagesAt(values)` gives the stages and the context they resolve in, without the crossings and the verdict: what
  a drawing needs, cheap enough to call for many values.

### Minor Changes

- 9280b78: The diagram moves to a new structure instead of swapping it: when a scenario, a story step or a control adds pods,
  brokers or partitions, the boxes that stay move and resize to their new places with their edges, what goes fades out,
  and what is new fades in, its edges drawing in last. `<Loadmap transition={0.8}>` sets how many seconds it takes (0
  cuts), and `transition: 0.8` in a `.loadmap` does the same in the editor, the docs and `loadmap record`; with reduced
  motion it always cuts, and so does a board paused with nothing stepping it. The load never moves the diagram, as
  before. The move runs on the engine's clock, so a recording shows it and stays the same file, byte for byte;
  `handle.ready()` waits for each of its frames to be drawn, `board().scene` is the frame drawn, and `reset()` ends a
  move. A `Scene`'s parts carry `fade` (and a new edge `draw`) only while it moves.

### Minor Changes

- 294378d: Light editing for readers: `<LoadmapEditor layout="reader">` shows the diagram with an inspector (a box's label,
  capacity and parameters; the model's load, growth and flows), each change a small edit of the text, and a shared link
  opens that way on the docs site. `format()` and `loadmap fmt` (`--check` for CI) lay a definition out the one way.
  `<Loadmap onNodeClick selected>`; in the editor a click on a box selects its lines, and **Format** (Shift+Alt+F).

### Minor Changes

- 2a8118b: Building blocks: a cache stage (hits answered and sent back), an autoscaled workers pool (min, max, target; a pods
  meter), a rate limiter (`limit` with a `configured` capacity) and retries that settle past capacity (`retry` with a
  budget). `at.<stage>.<flow>` reads what reaches a stage, a component without a demand takes it, and four new
  templates show each block.
