## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 7886094: A diagram without `layout` (or `direction`) runs right, or down when it fans out wider than it is long: when its
  widest layer has more boxes than its longest chain. The layers are counted as ELK draws them: every edge counts,
  whatever its `when` (so the load and the phases never turn it), a loop is cut where the flow comes back, a sink or
  store that feeds nothing stands in the last layer, and a box with no edge is left out. `directionOf(view)` gives it
  (from `@loadmap/layout` and `@loadmap/react`), and `layout()` runs by it when no direction is given; narrow screens
  still run down.

### Patch Changes

- @loadmap/core@0.14.0

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 2d8c547: The boxes nothing feeds stand first along the flow, and a sink or store that feeds nothing stands last. Tiers cut the
  diagram into bands across the flow (edge, services, data): `tier edge "Edge"` declares one, in the order the flow
  meets them, and `tier: edge` puts a box in it (`tiers: { edge: { label: 'Edge' } }` in the view and `tier: 'edge'`
  on a box in TypeScript). A box without a tier stands in the tier of the boxes that feed it. Each tier is a band behind
  its boxes, every other one shaded, with its label in the margin before them: across the top running right, up the
  left side running down and on a phone. `Scene.tiers` holds the bands; `collisions()` checks their labels too.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 497f671: No scenario, story step, preset or control moves a box any more. ELK lays out every box at the largest size it takes
  anywhere the model reaches, and each box is drawn at its own size in the middle of that slot: a pool that gains pods
  grows where it stands and its neighbours stay put. What it reaches: the defaults, each scenario, story step and
  declared preset, and every combination of the controls (a range at each step, or at points across a long one); past
  256 combinations, each control's options one at a time from each scenario, step and preset. Edges leave and enter a
  box at the middle of its sides, and an edge that comes or goes (`when`) keeps its room. Values nothing declared
  reaches (a combination past that bound that draws a box larger) lay out again, as before.

  `model.stagesAt(values)` gives the stages and the context they resolve in, without the crossings and the verdict: what
  a drawing needs, cheap enough to call for many values.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 9280b78: The diagram moves to a new structure instead of swapping it: when a scenario, a story step or a control adds pods,
  brokers or partitions, the boxes that stay move and resize to their new places with their edges, what goes fades out,
  and what is new fades in, its edges drawing in last. `<Loadmap transition={0.8}>` sets how many seconds it takes (0
  cuts), and `transition: 0.8` in a `.loadmap` does the same in the editor, the docs and `loadmap record`; with reduced
  motion it always cuts, and so does a board paused with nothing stepping it. The load never moves the diagram, as
  before. The move runs on the engine's clock, so a recording shows it and stays the same file, byte for byte;
  `handle.ready()` waits for each of its frames to be drawn, `board().scene` is the frame drawn, and `reset()` ends a
  move. A `Scene`'s parts carry `fade` (and a new edge `draw`) only while it moves.

### Minor Changes

- 294378d: Light editing for readers: `<LoadmapEditor layout="reader">` shows the diagram with an inspector (a box's label,
  capacity and parameters; the model's load, growth and flows), each change a small edit of the text, and a shared link
  opens that way on the docs site. `format()` and `loadmap fmt` (`--check` for CI) lay a definition out the one way.
  `<Loadmap onNodeClick selected>`; in the editor a click on a box selects its lines, and **Format** (Shift+Alt+F).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2a8118b: Building blocks: a cache stage (hits answered and sent back), an autoscaled workers pool (min, max, target; a pods
  meter), a rate limiter (`limit` with a `configured` capacity) and retries that settle past capacity (`retry` with a
  budget). `at.<stage>.<flow>` reads what reaches a stage, a component without a demand takes it, and four new
  templates show each block.
