## 0.15.0

### Patch Changes

- 1405fc9: A diagram the reader pans and zooms. `<Loadmap zoom>` (and `useLoadmap`, `<LoadmapSource>`) puts the zoom buttons on the board (− · the zoom · + · Fit): a drag pans, with a hand to hold it by, and a press that hardly moves is still a click on a box; a pinch zooms about its middle; the keys + − 0 and the arrows work while the board or a box has the focus, and a box the keyboard reaches outside the view comes into it. The wheel zooms about the pointer with Ctrl or ⌘ held (a trackpad's pinch too), so a page that scrolls keeps its wheel, and one finger scrolls the page until the reader zooms in. The zoom goes from 10 % to 400 % of one pixel a scene unit, a large diagram down to half its fit, and a diagram can never be dragged out of sight. `<Diagram canvas>` makes the board fill its container, as a canvas the wheel alone zooms, with no Full screen button; `canvas={{ left: 420, right: 340 }}` names the pixels the page floats over it, and Fit frames the whole diagram in what they leave. Play starts from the reader's view and flies out to the whole diagram; a drag while the story plays stops it where it is, and it ends fitted. With reduced motion the buttons and the keys jump. The code that pans and zooms loads with the first board that does: a page without `zoom` loads nothing more. Pictures, posters, GIFs and videos show what the camera frames, never the reader's view, as before. Full screen's compact panels and a box's detail now load when the reader first asks for them, so a `<Loadmap>` page loads less than before. The editor's diagram pans and zooms.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 6561c3d: A loadmap made to be framed. `<Loadmap fill>` (and `<LoadmapSource fill>`) fills its container laid out as full screen is, in `fullScreenMode`, for good: no full screen button, nothing scrolls; for a page of its own in an iframe, whose layout follows the frame as full screen follows the screen. `sharedValues(model, values)` in `@loadmap/dsl` reads a shared link's values by each parameter's kind and keeps only what still fits the model, as the editor does. `<LoadmapEditor embedLink={(hash, o) => url}>` puts "Copy embed link" beside "Share link": a menu that picks what the embed shows (`EmbedOptions`: the diagram, the default, or the panels too, the theme, the story played when it comes into view) and copies the link, or an `<iframe>` with it. The docs site has the page those links open, at `/embed/`, and a page on embedding in ClickUp and any page.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- ad0835d: `<LoadmapEditor fill>` fills its container, as a page of its own: the bar, then the text and the diagram side by side
  with a divider to drag (or move with the arrow keys; a double-click puts it back), each side scrolling on its own.
  Below 720 px wide, tabs switch between the text and the diagram, and the buttons other than Share fold into a menu.
  `start` puts controls at the bar's start (a way back, a name), and `split` with `onSplit` let a page keep where the
  divider was left. Without `fill` nothing changes.

### Minor Changes

- 0fb1d62: `theme="inherit"` follows the page's own light and dark switch, `data-theme="dark"` or a `dark` class on `<html>`,
  as it changes (the dots and the meters too), and the system's while the page sets none; `usePageTheme(theme)` gives
  the theme it resolves to. `<LoadmapEditor theme="inherit">` does the same. Two tokens fit the root into a card that
  has its own: `--lm-pad` (its padding, 16px) and `--lm-root-bg` (its background); full screen keeps both.

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- c1651c6: Full screen fits the screen without scrolling. The diagram stays on top, as wide as the screen; under it the verdict in
  one line (the load, how far the target holds, the first limit, how sure its capacity is) and the panels `fullScreen`
  lists in a compact form, side by side in a box the screen sizes: Live as small meters, where it runs out a line per
  component, the controls a line each, headroom as a sparkline, compare its first table, the assumptions a count. Rows
  that do not fit are left out whole and counted; each compact panel, "Why" and the assumptions open the panel whole over
  the diagram (its button closes it, and Esc in the overlay; the browser's own full screen takes Esc for itself). A phone
  shows one panel at a time under tabs, and pans the diagram in its own box. Nothing the load changes moves the board.

  A switch beside Close, or the F key, turns full screen into focus: the diagram, the story under it, and the verdict and
  the load slider when `fullScreen` lists them. `<Loadmap fullScreenMode="focus">` and `fullScreenMode: focus` in a
  `.loadmap` open full screen there (type `FullScreenMode`, default `'panels'`); the editor, the docs and the CLI viewer
  pass it on. The story bar gets Play: each step for its `seconds`, as `loadmap record --story` plays it, until the last
  or a value of the reader's own; its text keeps the room of the longest step.

  The controller has the state: `fullScreen`, `toggleFullScreen()`, `fullScreenMode`, `setFullScreenMode()`,
  `storyPlaying`, `setStoryPlaying()`. `<Loadmap>`'s `.lm-side` is now also `.lm-drawer`; a page of its own keeps its
  `.lm-side` under the board, in a box that scrolls on its own. `.lm-corner` is gone: nothing scrolls Close away.

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- bca623f: Full screen shows the diagram as wide as the screen, and below it every panel of the page: the verdict, Live and
  where it runs out beside the controls, then the headroom chart, the scenarios compared and what it assumes; the whole
  view scrolls, and the diagram never moves with the load. `<Loadmap fullScreen={['verdict', 'live', 'controls']}>`
  keeps only the panels it lists (`LOADMAP_PANELS`, type `LoadmapPanel`), and `fullScreen: [verdict, live, controls]`
  in a `.loadmap` does the same in the editor, the docs and `loadmap record`. A diagram in a narrow column turns to run
  left to right in full screen. Scrolled down to the panels, Close waits in the corner. `<Loadmap>` now wraps each
  panel in a `div.lm-panel` (`data-panel` names it), and `.lm-more` is gone: CSS that selected a panel as a child of
  `.lm-side` needs `.lm-panel` in between.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 294378d: Light editing for readers: `<LoadmapEditor layout="reader">` shows the diagram with an inspector (a box's label,
  capacity and parameters; the model's load, growth and flows), each change a small edit of the text, and a shared link
  opens that way on the docs site. `format()` and `loadmap fmt` (`--check` for CI) lay a definition out the one way.
  `<Loadmap onNodeClick selected>`; in the editor a click on a box selects its lines, and **Format** (Shift+Alt+F).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2a8118b: Building blocks: a cache stage (hits answered and sent back), an autoscaled workers pool (min, max, target; a pods
  meter), a rate limiter (`limit` with a `configured` capacity) and retries that settle past capacity (`retry` with a
  budget). `at.<stage>.<flow>` reads what reaches a stage, a component without a demand takes it, and four new
  templates show each block.
